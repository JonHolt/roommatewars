<h1>Roommate Wars</h1>
<h2>Game Design</h2>
<p>Basic Game Idea-  Our game is called Roommate Wars. You and a couple roommates get in a fight and start throwing 
		things at each other till only one is left standing. It is a multiplayer combat game from a top-down 2D perspective.
		It has a lot of competition and basic controls so anyone should be able to play.</p>

<p>Decision Making-  We would like to have players able to chose which room mate they are but that hasn't been implemented yet.
		With the multiplayer aspect, the player must choose who to attack first. And of course, there are going to be multiple buffs 
		player can go for. When a player is killed, any buff they had becomes available again. We do not yet have buffs working so at
		the moment there are not many available decisions.</p>
		
<p>Goals-  Our game has a very simple goal, kill all of your roommates! Only the survivor wins.</p>

<p>Opposition-  The other players. Originally, we wanted to have npc's as well but went more toward online multiplayer. We thought of giving
		each player a computer controlled army but couldn't get the npc's to properly move around the map while staying close to the player.</p>

<p>Managing Resources-  Our game currently does not have many resources. We want to add buffs in different locations that the player can find.
		Once a player has the buff, they keep it until they die. Once someone dies, all the other players would need to choose which of the
		dead players buffs they want to go for and race the other players there while still defending.</p>

<p>Game Tokens-  The main token is the player itself. We also have tokens for bullets and would like to add the ability to "pick a class"
		and choose what type of bullet your character throws. Right now we just have a PBR beer can for The Drunk. There would also be things
		like, hair ties for The Girlfriend, wads of garbage for The Slob, and joints for The Stoner. Finally, there would be tokens for the different
		possible buffs a player can have. Power- Attacks do more damamge. Health- Double health. Speed- Your player moves around faster. 
		Range- your attack go farther. Buffs were the last of the main things we wanted to work on and didn't get time to finish them.</p>
		
<p>Information-  The player doesn't need much information. On the main screen is some simple instructions for controlling your character.</p>		

<p>Color- Currently our game has almost no color to it. Our focus was not graphics so currently there is a very basic set of images.
		We want the game to feel like a couple of roommates, running around their apartment, attacking each other. Right now the only
		element that actually adds to the color is the PBR beer can bullets. Future development would include new sprites for each player
		along with a matching bullets and a couple of different textures for the map to make it feel like an apartment.</p>
		
<p>Diplomacy-  Any game with multiplayer will have some diplomacy because the players can choose to work together against another. If we get
		the buffs implemented, handling who gets what buff or who goes after what buff when someone dies will add some diplomacy.</p>
		
<p>Variety of Encounter-  At the moment, the map won't change much but the online multiplayer aspect helps ensure that no 2 fights will be the same.</p>

<h2>Future Development</h2>

<p>Graphics-  Getting a better set of sprites for characters and bullets and walls would really help it feel like room mates fighting in an 
		apartment.</p>

<p>AI-  Adding in some npc's for when less than 4 people are playing would be a big help. Or letting the players choose how many npc's are
		in each game. Possibly trying to have each player have 2 npc's that are tied to the player and travel around the map.</p>

<p>Multiple Game rooms-  At the moment, our server only works for one game running at a time. Allowing multiple rooms and allowing people to
		pick which room they join so friends could play together or you could try and meet new people.</p>	

<p>Buffs- This is one aspect we really wanted to get into our game but did not have time to finish. Allowing players to fight for power ups and
		collect them after people are dead will add a lot of diplomacy and decision making. You may want to kill one player over another 
		because they have a buff that makes them much harder to kill, or they got most of the buffs and are overpowered, or they got the buff
		you prefer so naturally, you must kill them first.</p>		
		
<p>Random Map Generation-  At the moment we have just one json map file. Writing some algorithms to generate random maps would greatly increase
		variety of encounter.</p>	

<p>Mouse Controls-  Currently, the game only works with keyboard controls. We would like to add the ability to play with a mouse.</p>		
		
<h2>Group Information</h2>

<p>Jon- Jon's focus for this game was mostly networking. Setting up a server and clients that can connect up to 4 people for play. The main issues
		were getting the client to properly draw what was sent and to have the server correctly send to the clients. </p>
		
<p>Devon-  Devon's focus was general game design concepts and getting the physics for the character to work. This included handling collisions and 
		movement control. He also created the map format and a basic map file.</p>
		
<p>Overall, our focus was game design. Neither of us felt the need to focus on graphics and we had a lot of issues trying to include AI players
		that worked with the network so we decided the networking aspect was more important.</p>
